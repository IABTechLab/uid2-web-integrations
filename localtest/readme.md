This setup is intended to allow developers to easily run local TLS services with apparently "real" DNS names and locally valid certificates. This allows testing of a variety of scenarios, such as 1st-party related-domain cookies, CSTG, and iframe behaviour.

## Getting started

There are a few steps you need to take for this to work. Please see [setup.md](./setup.md) for details.

## Overview

For details about how to start the server, how the files & folders are laid out, how to use React, and HTML templating, see [overview.md](./overview.md).

## Scenarios

For information about the kinds of scenarios you can test, see [scenarios.md](./scenarios.md).

## Configuration

For information about other things you can configure, see [configuration.md](./configuration.md).
